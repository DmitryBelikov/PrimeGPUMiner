***CHANGE LOG***

08/01/18
  -removed nPrimeLimitB, nSharedSizeKB, nThreadsKernelA from config.ini since
   sieve will be replaced eventually

  -added nSieveIterationsLog2 and nTestLevels to data drive more tuning options

  -fixed prime ratio wrapping bug

  -fixed CPU utilization bug. freed up massive amount of CPU cycles

08/02/18
  -fixed serverconnection connecting before GPU device initialization. Now
   stats won't be biased during first block after connection

  -revisited CPU/GPU utilization, added a conservative sleep to GPU threads so 
   they don't spin/wait and burn up most of the CPU cycles

  -changed sieving stats from MiB/s to GiB/s to future proof scaling stats

08/03/18

   -decoupled total tests/s into gpu tests/s and cpu tests/s

   -added nine chain meter (for those that are extremely lucky!)

   -changed counters to std::atomic<uint32_t> types to avoid race conditions

08/05/18

   -fixed bug related to computing fermat remainder

   -added base offset to offsets.ini to enable different primorial offset patterns

08/08/18

	 -got rid of remaining cruft files and built custom makefile for linux

08/09/18

   -changed bit array radix from 8-bit to 32-bit to eliminate uneeded casting and
    code cleanliness

   -got rid of typedefs for uint32_t and uint64_t as they introduce compile problems
    for Windows. cleaned up some misc. code

   -added Mixed GPU support (CUDA only)

   -added up to 32 GPU support (for those with ridiculous mining rigs)
